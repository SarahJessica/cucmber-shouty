# Cucumber Training
Learning cucumber.io while making the Shouty App.

## Shouty

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 1000m can hear it.

Shouty doesn't exist yet - you will implement it yourself!

That is, if you're attending a BDD/Cucumber course.
